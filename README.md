Address Book Manager is a web application that enables users to manage their contact information. The application has been developed using modern front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, Reactjs, and Tailwind. The database used in this project is Browser Local Storage, which has been used for simple comprehension purposes. However, if needed, the application can be updated to use a more robust NoSQL database like MongoDB.

The application allows users to add, edit, delete, and search for contacts using a user-friendly interface. Users can input their contact details such as name, address, and phone number. The information is then stored in the local storage, making it easily accessible for future reference.

The Address Book Manager project is designed to be intuitive and straightforward, making it accessible to a wide range of users. The application is also highly customizable, allowing users to tailor the interface to their individual preferences. With its modern design and robust functionality, the Address Book Manager is a useful tool for anyone looking to manage their contacts efficiently.
